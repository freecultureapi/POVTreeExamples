You need to download and run POV ray to use these files

Put the .pov and .ini files in the same folder

put the tree file (in this case maple) into your "include" folder which is within the main pov ray folder

From there this will render out. If you render from the .pov file it will just render one image but if you render from the .ini it will do the whole 200 frame animations
